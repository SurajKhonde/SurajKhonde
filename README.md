# MERN Stack Developer
# About Me
Hello, I'm Suraj Khonde, hailing from India. I graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering back in 2018. Following my graduation, I embarked on a three-year journey within the financial domain, exploring various roles and responsibilities.
# current
Recently, I transitioned into the realm of MERN stack development, joining Avrish Technology. As a MERN stack developer, I've had the opportunity to work on both the client and server sides of web development. Throughout my journey, I've tackled challenges such as optimizing API calls to reduce server costs for clients. Moreover, I've focused on enhancing user experiences by creating more intuitive, interactive, and responsive client interfaces.

One of the strengths I bring to the table is my ability to comprehend and work with code from both ends of the spectrum. This proficiency enables me to contribute to the development of efficient web applications, ensuring end-to-end security and cost-effectiveness.

In addition to my technical expertise, I'm currently working on a revolutionary product designed specifically for developers, aimed at providing a comprehensive solution to all career-related challenges. This project, called SkillForge, is geared towards empowering developers to overcome obstacles and achieve their professional goals through mentorship, collaboration, and skill development. SkillForge serves as a platform where developers can connect, learn, and grow, all in one place.

I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and am always eager to take on new challenges in the ever-evolving world of web development.


### Frontend Technologies

- **JavaScript (Vanilla & React):** I have honed my skills in both vanilla JavaScript and React to create engaging and interactive user experiences.
- **CSS (TailwindCSS):** While the basics of CSS are familiar to me, I've mastered TailwindCSS to streamline the styling process and enhance the visual appeal of my applications.
- **Bundlers (Parcel):** Trust me, Parcel is a beast when it comes to handling bundling tasks efficiently.

### Backend Technologies

- **Node.js & Express:** I leverage the power of Node.js and Express to build scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- **Database (MongoDB with Mongoose):** My backend proficiency extends to MongoDB, and I use Mongoose to seamlessly interact with the database.
- **Tools (Nodemon, Axios, Multer):** I make use of Nodemon for automatic server restarts, Axios for handling API requests, and Multer for smooth image and video uploads.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend:** Explore the `client` directory to find my frontend code, showcasing the application's user interface and interactivity.
- **Backend:** The `server` directory houses the backend code, including Express routes, database models, and server configurations.
