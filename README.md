# JavaScript Full Stack Project

Welcome to my JavaScript full-stack project repository! ðŸš€ In this repository, I showcase my expertise in building robust and dynamic web applications using a variety of technologies.

## About Me

I am a passionate developer with a proven track record of delivering over 15 projects using vanilla JavaScript. My journey extends beyond the basics, as I have also delved into React, crafting more than 3 projects that showcase my proficiency in building modern and responsive user interfaces.

### Frontend Technologies

- **JavaScript (Vanilla & React):** I have honed my skills in both vanilla JavaScript and React to create engaging and interactive user experiences.
- **CSS (TailwindCSS):** While the basics of CSS are familiar to me, I've mastered TailwindCSS to streamline the styling process and enhance the visual appeal of my applications.
- **Bundlers (Parcel):** Trust me, Parcel is a beast when it comes to handling bundling tasks efficiently.

### Backend Technologies

- **Node.js & Express:** I leverage the power of Node.js and Express to build scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- **Database (MongoDB with Mongoose):** My backend proficiency extends to MongoDB, and I use Mongoose to seamlessly interact with the database.
- **Tools (Nodemon, Axios, Multer):** I make use of Nodemon for automatic server restarts, Axios for handling API requests, and Multer for smooth image and video uploads.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend:** Explore the `client` directory to find my frontend code, showcasing the application's user interface and interactivity.
- **Backend:** The `server` directory houses the backend code, including Express routes, database models, and server configurations.
