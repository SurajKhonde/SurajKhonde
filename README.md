"Why JavaScript?" you ask? Well, let me answer in my own quirky way.

You see, Node.js â€” which is built on JavaScript â€” is single-threaded. That means it handles one task at a time, with complete focus.
And guess what? Thatâ€™s exactly like me! ðŸ˜Ž

Iâ€™m not into multitasking chaos. No endless calls, no random chit-chat.
Just give me a peaceful corner, let me put my phone on silent, and boom â€” Iâ€™m deep in my task, just like Node's event loop.

I allocate time for social stuff too, but not the whole day â€” just like Node, which knows how to prioritize efficiently.
It first tackles lightweight tasks that boost performance â€” just like I start my day with small wins to fuel my confidence ðŸ’ª.

Asynchronous tasks? Yep, I do those too! When I get a moment between things, I might take a quick note, let my brain rest, or sneak in a power nap. That's my version of async I/O ðŸ˜´.

So the moral of the story is:
I love doing one focused thing at a time â€” just like Node.js. We both thrive in the single-threaded world.

Thereâ€™s a saying:
"When two things think alike, they work together best."
Thatâ€™s why I became a Node.js developer â€” because our mindsets match. ðŸ’»ðŸ§
